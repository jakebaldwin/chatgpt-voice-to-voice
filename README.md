# Voice to Voice for Foreign Language

This repo is to allow you to have someone to talk french to! (Feel free to edit the prompt in the source code to change it to whatever language you want to learn)

## Requirements

You will need an openai API key with ample credits. I placed my key in a directory ../boring/fte_key.txt relative to where this was cloned. Do the same for the simplest version!

## To Run

Simply create a venv, and install the requirements via

`python -m venv venv/`

`source venv/bin/activate`

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

then to run,

`python voiceToVoice.py`

Enjoy!
